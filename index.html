  <h2>About Jino</h2>
  <p>Since I was young I have always been passionate about technology and helping people.
    This leads me into working as an IT engineer supporting end-users and network infrastructure
    for various global enterprises. I applied my knowledge and skills in systems, applications,
    and networking to solve users' problems and deliver technical solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    My passion for technology and creativity leads me into transitioning to Software Engineering where
    I can utilize my background and experiences, to help and empathize with users to resolve
    issues and create meaningful user experiences.
